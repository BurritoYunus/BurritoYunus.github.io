				<h1>Manipulation of the</br>
				presidential election</h1>
				<p>Psychologist Michal Kosinski developed a method to analyze people 
				to the smallest detail, based on their Facebook-activity.
				Was a similar tool used to let Donald Trump take over in The White House?
				contrary to all prevailing statistical, Donald J. Trump had won the
				Presidential election in the United States</p>
				<p>Kosinski sat down for a while and watched the celebration and
				the results that were gathered from the individual states, with
				this feeling that the election results could have something do to
				with his own research. Was this feeling correct?</p>
